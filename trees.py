2. Given a n-ary tree, describe a data structure to hold it & support these operations:

i. Find all parents of a given node
ii. Find all children of a given node
iii. Find all siblings of a given node

Answer: He started out with a "Union Find" function that he was using to partition the tree. This was unrelated to the solution. I had to suggest that I was looking for a data structure (Java class or such) that could hold the nodes & have operations on it. He was unable to give me any solution at all. As a result I had to forego my elaboration of this question to further detail.


Print all prime numbers between 1 & a very large number (1M).
Answer: Gave me brute force to loop O(N^2) . I gave him hints - he was only able to progress in small steps with every hint. He would easily go off on tangents and I had to rope him in to focusing on the problem at hand.
Finally, he was unable to give me any solutions to optimize it further. I was looking for a final solution that was a O9n^2) but better by a constant factor.
